LootBags Repatched
========

A Repatched Version of Lootbags for 1.12.2

LootBags has a Custom License that says when the Mod Dev is Absence someone can modify the mod. If Malorolam requests it, I will take this down.

```1a: If a modified version of the code is to be used to update the mod in my absence, whether percieved or actual, regardless if the work is done independantly or from the request of a pack developer, inform me of the action.```
